<h1> Summary Latitude vs. X</h1>
 <p>The purpose of this project was to analyze the how the weather changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis, we first pulled data from the 
   <a href = "https://openweathermap.org/api" target = "_blank">  OpenWeatherMap API </a> 
   to  assemble a dataset on over 500 cities. 
 </p>

 <p> After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included: temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
